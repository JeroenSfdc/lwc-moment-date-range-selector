# Lightning Web Component using MomentJS 

My first LWC leveraging the MomemtJS ES6 import to build a lightweight date period selector component

Wrapped within an Aura component, to enable exposure in a Flow. 

Very rough-edged yet, but it proves the sheer easyness to compose a LWC with available ES6 libraries out there!
